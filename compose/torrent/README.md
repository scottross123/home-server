# TORRETNING

Because Docker Swarm is a PIA to get working with this I can't link containers together, I am leaving the torrenting setup in docker compose. In the future I will try to build a custom monolothic image that includes both deluge and the protonvpn-cli and hopefully that will just work. Or I might just migrate to everything to Kubernetes and do something different.
